This repository contains my homework solutions to the [Performance-Aware
Programming course](https://www.computerenhance.com/p/table-of-contents).

In [Part 1](./part1) we wrote a partial 8086 disassembler and simulator. This
was done as an introduction to assembly. It also provided a historical context
for x64 assembly, and can be used to reference both similarities as well as
differences in today's architecture.

In [Part 2](./part2) we wrote a file generator outputting some data in a
certain JSON format, and a parser to read the data back and do some
calculations. We then began implementing an instrumented profiler and used the
file parser as an experimentation ground in which to use the profiler.

[Part 3](./part3) is currently ongoing. We have written a repetition tester and
are working on getting a feel for different performance aspects of the virtual
memory subsystem and the CPU.
